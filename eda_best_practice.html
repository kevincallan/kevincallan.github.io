          <p>
            tl:dr: This note demonstrates why including best practices in
            exploratory data analysis improves your ability to understand and
            make decisions. These best practices are applicable to a broad range
            of analyses and not specific to a team, function or company but
            provide a lightweight framework for analysing vast amounts of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              The practices include, robust problem definition, structured
              presentation of findings and peer review. * They are not
              prescriptive rules but following them, even partially makes
              analysis more consistent and of higher quality.

          <b>Why Bother With Best Practices?</b><br />

          In any data driven organisation or any organisation each piece of
          analysis aims to drive understanding and decisions. <br />Stating the
          obvious, it’s important to get that right. <br />At the same time
          however any additional process creates friction, so one should only
          add more friction where it adds net positive utility.<br />

          Following best practices serves a few purposes;

          <li>
            It helps catch obvious mistakes like using the wrong data sources or
            omitting key results
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduces both cognitive and statistical bias
          </li>
          <li>
            Grows individuals in problem solving and technical domains
          </li>
          <br />

          <p>
            If organizations don’t follow best practices in some form they miss
            things that should have been caught or avoided, in turn making
            suboptimal decisions.<br />

            For a fraud this could be overstating how much of a risk is on a
            platform or by not considering the downstream cost (like more false
            positives) associated with a product solution. <br />

            If you have time I’d recommend reading this
            (https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist) New
            Yorker article about how the use of checklists in ICU and aviation
            has helped saved innumerable lives and millions of dollars, it’s
            helpful because it drills home the point *that qualified and capable
            people are not immune from basic errors.<br />

            Simply put, following agreed best practices reduces oversights and
            improves the standard of our analysis making the additional friction
            is worthwhile.<br />
          </p>

          <li>
            These best practices are not supposed to be completely prescriptive
            however as any analysis is heavily context dependent.
          </li>

          <li>
            The below are guidelines and including them ensures analysis with
            quality and consistency.

            >Best Practices <br />
            1. Define The Problem</b
          >
          <br />

          Analysis should start with defining the problem, stating what you are
          trying to understand or the hypothesis you’re trying to test. Without
          a well structured problem definition, analysis can be directionless.
          It also makes goal setting and evaluating success more subjective. The
          practice of defining problems leads to a better articulation of the
          issues at hand, more thoughtfulness in our approach and ultimately
          better outcomes. A hypothesis is a definitive explanation of something
          that can have its validity tested. Including this is an optimal state
          but not always feasible as initial analysis often consists of
          ‘understand’ type work. Ideally this would include a critical
          quantitative threshold that would allow you to accept or reject the
          proposed hypothesis, allowing us to decide to move forward with
          changing or building something. Here’s a link to some examples
          (https://hbr.org/2012/09/the-power-of-defining-the-prob) of how
          effective problem definition.
