          <p>
            tl:dr: This note demonstrates why including best practices in
            exploratory data analysis improves your ability to understand and
            make decisions. These best practices are applicable to a broad range
            of analyses and not specific to a team, function or company but
            provide a lightweight framework for analysing vast amounts of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              The practices include, robust problem definition, structured
              presentation of findings and peer review. * They are not
              prescriptive rules but following them, even partially makes
              analysis more consistent and of higher quality.

            <b>Why Bother With Best Practices?</b><br />

            In any data driven organisation or any organisation each piece of
            analysis aims to drive understanding and decisions. <br />Stating
            the obvious, it’s important to get that right. <br />At the same
            time however any additional process creates friction, so one should
            only add more friction where it adds net positive utility.<br />

            Following best practices serves a few purposes;

            <li>
              It helps catch obvious mistakes like using the wrong data sources
              or omitting key results
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduces both cognitive and statistical bias
            </li>
