          <h1 class="major">Exploratory Analysis Best Practice</h1>
          <p>
            <b>tl:dr:</b> This note demonstrates why including best practices in
            exploratory data analysis improves your ability to understand and
            make decisions. These best practices are applicable to a broad range
            of analyses and not specific to a team, function or company but
            provide a lightweight framework for analysing vast amounts of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              The practices include, robust problem definition, structured
              presentation of findings and peer review. * They are not
              prescriptive rules but following them, even partially makes
              analysis more consistent and of higher quality.
            </li>

          </p>
          <h2 class="major">Why Bother With Best Practices?</h2>
          <br />

          In any data driven organisation or any organisation each piece of
          analysis aims to drive understanding and decisions. <br />Stating the
          obvious, it’s important to get that right. <br />
          <br />At the same time however any additional process creates
          friction, so one should only add more friction where it adds net
          positive utility.<br />

          Following best practices serves a few purposes; <br />

          <li>
            It helps catch obvious mistakes like using the wrong data sources or
            omitting key results
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduces both cognitive and statistical bias
          </li>
          <li>
            Grows individuals in problem solving and technical domains
          </li>
          <br />

          <p>
            If organizations don’t follow best practices in some form they miss
            things that should have been caught or avoided, in turn making
            suboptimal decisions. For a fraud this could be overstating how much
            of a risk is on a platform or by not considering the downstream cost
            (like more false positives) associated with a product solution.
            <br />

            If you have time I’d recommend reading
            <a
              this
              href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist"
            ></a>
            New Yorker article about how the use of checklists in ICU and
            aviation has helped saved innumerable lives and millions of dollars,
            it’s helpful because it drills home the point
            <b>
              that qualified and capable people are not immune from basic
              errors.</b
            >
            <br />

            Simply put, following agreed best practices reduces oversights and
            improves the standard of our analysis making the additional friction
            is worthwhile.<br />
          </p>

          <li>
            These best practices are not supposed to be completely prescriptive
            however as any analysis is heavily context dependent.
          </li>

          <li>
            The below are guidelines and including them ensures analysis with
            quality and consistency.
          </li>

          <h2 class="major">Best Practices</h2>
          <br />
          <h3 class="major">1. Define The Problem</h3>
          <br />

          Analysis should start with defining the problem, stating what you are
          trying to understand or the hypothesis you’re trying to test. Without
          a well structured problem definition, analysis can be directionless.
          It also makes goal setting and evaluating success more subjective. The
          practice of defining problems leads to a better articulation of the
          issues at hand, more thoughtfulness in our approach and ultimately
          better outcomes. A hypothesis is a definitive explanation of something
          that can have its validity tested. Including this is an optimal state
          but not always feasible as initial analysis often consists of
          ‘understand’ type work. Ideally this would include a critical
          quantitative threshold that would allow you to accept or reject the
          proposed hypothesis, allowing us to decide to move forward with
          changing or building something. Here’s a link to some examples
          (https://hbr.org/2012/09/the-power-of-defining-the-prob) of how
          effective problem definition. <br /><br />
          <br />
          <h3 class="major">2. Presenting findings</h3>
          <br />
          <h3 class="major">2.1 Assumptions & Trade Offs</h3>
          <br />

          <li>
            We make assumptions in every piece of work we do.
          </li>
          <li>
            About the data we use, how much it reflects reality and how much
            historical events predict future outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do this both consciously and subconsciously. Being more aware of
            the assumptions and trade offs made leads us to make more informed
            decisions.
          </li>
          <br />
          <h3 class="major">How does this work in practice?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            One commonly made assumption is about the data we use. One might
            write a query using a particular SQL table and look at a particular
            time period, say the last three months. The assumption implicitly
            made here is that the table contains accurate information and the
            historical time period is going to be reflective of what the future
            will be. These are both assumptions. Being aware of them helps us
            understand the constraints and limitations to our analysis. A trade
            off is a compromise made between two incompatible things, for
            example metrics that move in opposite directions. Such as fraud rate
            and merchant revenue. If a team enforces on more things it reduce
            rates of fraud but at the same time decrease revenue. Including this
            in analysis is important because when we propose solutions these
            things are at odds with each other. You want to be able to ask
            yourself the following question; Is this conclusion reasonable given
            the assumptions and trade offs?
            <br />
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="major">2.2 Key Findings and Next Steps</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The entire point of analysing something is to discover something
            previously unknown. A solid analysis highlights this front and
            centre while also laying out clear next steps. By doing this, the
            consumer of your work knows what was discovered, why it matters to
            them and how it plays a role in the larger collection of problems
            you are trying to solve.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="major">3. Reference & Peer Review</h3>
          <br />
          <p>Referencing and peer review play an important role in analysis.</p>
          <li>
            Citing any source that resulted in you reaching your conclusion
            helps verification and reproducibility. This could be SQL, python
            notebooks or even news articles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analysis peer review allows us to reduce errors and oversight,
            limits bias and also allows individuals to grow through constructive
            feedback and inclusion of diverse perspectives.
          </li>
          <p>
            These practices manifest themselves in different ways for different
            teams, for example an engineering peer review will be different to a
            DS review. However following them helps collectively make better
            decisions, helps individuals grow and produces more consistent and
            higher quality work.
